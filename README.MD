# Brandcoders Code Challenge

This is a custom WordPress theme for a code challenge to create a custom post type, taxonomy, and template in WordPress using PHP.

## Github Repository: https://github.com/DylanRamsey/wp-challenge

### Web server: nginx
### PHP Version 8.1.9
### Database MySQL 8.0.16
### WordPress version 6.2.2
### Plugins Used:
- Advanced Custom Fields(ACF)

ACF custom fields were chosen for this challenge over using the built in Wordpress fields for better Image fields.

SASS code was written to follow AIR BNB style guiding
[Airbnb SCSS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css) 

### Personal SASS code organizion I follow:
- CSS Properties in ABC order

### Custom style guiding I follow ontop of this:
- Font sizes in REMS
- Media queries in REMS

Styling is added in assets/sass

The SASS will compile to the style.css file for wordpress. Do not edit this file directly, the SASS file will overwrite it. 

Setup SASS to watch for updates and compile to style.css
- npm install -g sass
- sass --watch ./assets/sass/main.scss style.css
